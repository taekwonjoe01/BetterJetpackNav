/*
-Update to latest nav component version.
    -Need to allow nav structure to accept non -BaseNavFragments as navigations.
-Action menu?

-How to style via xml? Test style at runtime?

-Add all toolbar features like subtitles and look for others.



TESTING
-Test forward and back navigations
-Test constants used in nav graph as arguments
-Test overriding and that overriding persists through various screen rotations and navigations. All screens on back stack should
restore overrides, but if popped, they reset back to their initial defaults
