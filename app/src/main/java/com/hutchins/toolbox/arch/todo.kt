/*
-Update to latest nav component version.
    -Need to allow nav structure to accept non -BaseNavFragments as navigations.

TESTING
-Test forward and back navigations
-Test constants used in nav graph as arguments
-Test overriding and that overriding persists through various screen rotations and navigations. All screens on back stack should
restore overrides, but if popped, they reset back to their initial defaults
