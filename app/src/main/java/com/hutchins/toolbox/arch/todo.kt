/*
-Need viewModels to persist toolbar state for screens. This has to happen in the level where viewModels are included with the project.
-Update to latest nav component version.
    -Need to allow nav structure to accept non -BaseNavFragments as navigations.
-Action menu?

-BottomNav up arrow does nothing
-NoNav up does nothing.

-Test navUI constants



TESTING
-Test forward and back navigations
-Test constants used in nav graph as arguments
-Test overriding and that overriding persists through various screen rotations and navigations. All screens on back stack should
restore overrides, but if popped, they reset back to their initial defaults.
